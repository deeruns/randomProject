#if dependencies change, then you need to rezip the file and make a new version

#every time you update the labmdas or the layers you need to rerun the update layers and upload lambdas script
#Updatelayers AFTER upload lambdas
# uploadlambdas first
#if you ever change something in shared module, or install someting, change layer version and run update layers

#basically take our server classes and put them in the server module (copy them over)
